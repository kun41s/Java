/*
You will be given the source and destination of all the tickets in the form of a map, and you have to print the itinerary from all those tickets.

Note:

    The path covered by the tickets is not circular.
    Other than the final destination, there is exactly one ticket from every city.


Input: The input will be in the following format:

    The first line will be an integer ‘n’ indicating the size of the map containing the source and the destination of all the tickets.
    The next ‘n’ lines will be the source and the destination of all the tickets.
    Each line represents the source and the destination of each ticket, separated by space.


Output: The output should be in the following format
    Print all the names of the cities in the itinerary, separated by a space.
    Note:

    If you cannot get the start of the itinerary, print 'Invalid'.
    If multiple itineraries are possible and if they are also valid, then print the itinerary that is the largest in lexicographical order when the complete itinerary is treated as a string. Refer to the ‘Sample Test case 2’ given below.


Sample test case 1:

Input:

4
Mumbai Indore
Hyderabad Warangal
Indore Hyderabad
Delhi Mumbai

Output:

Delhi Mumbai Indore Hyderabad Warangal

Sample test case 2:

Input:
2
abc def
abc deg

Output:
abc deg

Sample test case 3:
Input:
3
abc def
abc deg
deg fgt

Output:
abc deg fgt
